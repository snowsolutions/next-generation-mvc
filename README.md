# Laravel Application: Multi-vendor + AIO Platform in MVC structure

The project structure is design base on assumption that we have 2 individual platforms and merge into 1 SaaS application

## Overview

Although, the project contains zero real code that can test, deploy or use in real scenarios. But the structure, model design, platform components are reference from most trusted platform like Salesforce, Magento, Zendesk...

## System Requirements

Webserver Apache or Nginx or simply use built-in PHP server (artisan serve)
- PHP 8.1+
- MySQL 5.7+


## Architecture

The project architecture is base on the MVC structure provided by Laravel with some functional-directories to decorate the functionality like:
- Binding Resolution: allow developer to define reference between an abstract to a concrete class (context and non-context, instance or singleton)
- Contracts: allow developer to manage interfaces
- Helpers: allow developer to manage global, instance scope helper functions
- Jobs: allow developer to manage all delay tasks, scheduled tasks
- Integrations: allow developer to separate and manage integration code to 3rd Parties
- Repositories: allow developer to store repository class that contains methods to query data from model
- Services: allow developer to design and implement application business logic, services involves multiple repositories. By using services, developer can avoid cross reference between repositories and conflict in binding strategy.
- Traits: allow developer to manage Traits, class scope helper functions like: platform access check, text translation across locale...

Both MVC directories and functional-directories are design to handle multi platform in One application model, so they possess sub directory after the name of the platform like:
- CommercePlatform
- HelpdeskPlatform
- System

Building API backend also require a focus on versioning routes so the `controllers` folder is separated into `Api\V1` and `Api\V2`.
With a proper binding resolution and route configurations (at `routes/commerce_platform/v1.php` or `routes/commerce_platform/v1.php` or `routes/helpdesk_platform/v2.php` or `routes/helpdesk_platform/v2.php` ...), we can deploy an application that can scale, extend and refactoring risk-free.


## Dependency Injection & Binding

To use dependency injection in a proficient way, the provider `BindingResolutionProvider` will automatically pick up binding map from `BindingResolution` directory base on different mode: Contextual or Non-Contextual, Instance or Singleton
